## Overview

After building several full-stack applications, I had been eager to venture into creating an e-commerce app, primarily to incorporate a Content Management System(CMS) into the system. Consequently, I delved into learning Redux Toolkit for state management and endeavored to integrate all the components, which included headless Strapi CMS for managing products across various categories and Stripe for handling payments. To host the application, I utilized Railway for a remote backend database and successfully deployed it there.
